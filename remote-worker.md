# Remote Worker Physical Security Checklist

This document breaks down a few basic and intermediate areas for securing your digital devices and router infrastructure while working remotely.

## Basic Steps

[ ] Important documents, thumb drives, and other devices are locked in a safe or file cabinet, which is mounted to something that would be difficult to carry out of your house
[ ] When working outside of the home on an untrusted wi-fi network, you use a trusted VPN solution to connect to the internet
[ ] The default password on your internet router has been changed to a robust one (such as a 20-character random password stored in your password manager)
[ ] You use dedicated work machines for work and personal machines for personal use
[ ] Semi-trusted devices such as cloud-networked devices are connected to your Wi-Fi Guest network
[ ] Guests are restricted to your Wi-Fi Guest network
[ ] You use a robust Wi-Fi access point password, such as a 20-character random password saved in your [ ] Password Manager, and enforce modern encryption (WPA2-PSK with AES or greater)
[ ] You have disabled WPS on your Wi-Fi router
[ ] You have disabled Universal Plug-N-Play on your Wi-Fi router
[ ] You have enabled any firewalls and DoS protection mechanisms on your router
[ ] Important documents once used are shredded

## Intermediate Steps
[ ] When possible, you use an ethernet connection to your router instead of Wi-Fi
[ ] Your work machines are network segmented from other devices at home, such as through the use of the [Three Dumb Routers setup](https://pcper.com/2016/08/steve-gibsons-three-router-solution-to-iot-insecurity/) or Guest networks with networking disabled between devices
